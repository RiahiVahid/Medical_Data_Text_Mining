In this project, we are working with messy medical data and using regex to extract relevant infromation from the data.

Each line of the MessyMedicalData.txt file corresponds to a medical note. Each note has a date that needs to be extracted, but each date is encoded in one of many formats.

The main aim of this project is to correctly identify and then extract all of the different date variants encoded in this dataset.
